Useful Shopify API bits of code

Going through my old repos and finding useful bits of Shopify code.

1. inventory.py

Used to update inventory, takes a list of product id's (ids.txt) and sets the quantity to 0. Good for marking out of stock products or making unavailable products available. 

2. product_scraper.py

Scrapes websites with categories of products and uploads them to Shopify with collections. This code was specific for a certain website but with some tweaking it will work with other ones.
